Sauce
1.5 lbs of ground beef, browned & drained of fat
1 can of tomato puree
1 can of water from the tomato puree can
about 5 or more basil leaves, chopped (or snipped with scissors)
1 bay leaf

Filling
1 lb mozzarella, sliced
1 large container of ricotta cheese
1-2 boxes of no-boil lasagna noodles (Barilla is good)
grated parmesan or romano cheese

Lightly brown 5 cloves of garlic in oil and add about a 1/4 cup of
diced fresh parsley
Mix in the tomato paste & a can of water from the tomato paste can.
Add to rest of sauce ingredients above. Add salt & pepper and about a
tablespoon of sugar. Simmer for a couple of hours (doesn't have to get
too thick).

Take the bay leaf out of the sauce. Cover the bottom of the lasagna
pan with a light layer of sauce, then start layering noodles, sauce,
small dollops of ricotta, slices of mozzarella (I usually put the mozz
directly on the ricotta and "smush" it down) and sprinkle parmesan
cheese.  Should take about 4 layers.

Bake at 350 for 30 min covered with foil, then bake another 30 minutes
uncovered until heated through.
