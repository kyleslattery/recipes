Ingredients
 
Sauce
 
notes: 
 
1)  the measurements for parsley on down is very loose.  I never measure these. 
2)  I generally make multiple batches (2 or 3) and freeze the extra.
3)  Plain sauce for chicken parm etc. is the same recipe without the bay leaf.
 
1)  Large can (15 or so oz.) whole peeled tomatoes.  (if less cooking time required, use crushed and less water)
2)  Small can tomato paste (prefer with italian seasoning)
3)  parsley - 1/4 cup or less, chopped
4)  garlic - 5 cloves (I cheat on the high side sometimes) crushed/diced.  I use a garlic press
5)  basil - fresh is best, 5 or so leaves cut with scissors.  Dried, tablespoon or so
6)  bay leaf - one large
7)  sugar - not really sure, 1/8 cup.  This can be adjusted to taste later
8)  salt - tablespoon or so
9)  pepper - fairly small amount
 
1)  In sauce pot, add tomatoes and one can of water.  I break the tomatoes to help them break down better.  I don't know if this is useful or not.
2)  Add basil, garlic, bay leaf, sugar, salt, pepper.
3)  Bring to boil and simmer
 
4)  In fry pan add olive oil, parsley and garlic.  saute until just before the garlic turns brown (maybe 5 minutes.).
5)  Add in paste and 1 can of paste water.  Stir while heat in on until all ingredients are mixed and mixture starts to boil.
6)  Add to sauce pot.  It doesn't matter how far along the sauce is.  I usually get the sauce heating, do this and add them when this if complete.
 
7)  Prepare meatballs/sausage and add them in.  I sometimes hold off on putting the meatballs in until an hour before completion because they can break down. 
8)  Depending on how much fat the meat has retained, I will skim off what collects at the top of the pot in the last 30 minutes of cooking.
9)  Remove bay leaf before serving
 
 
Meat
 
1 pound of meat per batch will be enough to serve with the sauce.  The sauce can handle 1.5 pounds if you want extras.
 
Sausage:
 
1)  Italian sausage. 
2)  Boil in water 10 - 15 minutes (this is to reduce the time for the next step.  Not required).
3)  Brown sausage in fry pan until cooked through.
4)  Cut (if desired) to serving size and put in sauce pot.
 
Meatballs:  I don't think this recipe in anything special but it is what I use.
 
1)  Ground beef or a mix of Ground beef, pork and veal (available in some stores).
2)  Parmesan cheese - 1/4 cup or so
3)  Italian bread crumbs - more later
4)  Parsley - 1/8 cup
5)  1 egg is good for about 1.5 lbs.
 
1)  mix all ingredients.   Start with about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.
2)  Add in bread crumbs until the correct consistency
3)  Saute in fry pan until brown on all sides (some people bake).
4)  Remove to plate with paper towel to remove some fat
5)  Put in sauce immediately or wait until later (if worried about extended cooking time).
