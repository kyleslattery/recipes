Chocolate Caramel Cookies with White Chocolate Glaze 
====================================================
- 1 c. butter, softened
- 1 c. plus 1 Tbsp sugar, divided
- 1 c. packed brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2.5 c. all-purpose flour
- 0.75 c. baking cocoa
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1.75 c. chopped pecans, divided
- 1 package (13 oz.) Rolo candies
- 4 squares (1 oz. each) white baking chocolate, melted

Suggestions
-----------
* Put Rolos in fridge or freezer before using so they don’t melt too much.
* Use parchment paper on cookie sheets to bake.  Pull parchment paper with cookies off the cookie sheets to cool.
* When forming the balls, roll with the palms of your hands rather than your fingers.

Directions
----------

In a mixing bowl, cream butter, 1 cup sugar and brown sugar.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in vanilla.  Combine the flour, cocoa, and baking soda; gradually add to the creamed mixture, beating just until combined.  Stir in ½ c. pecans (if using). Shape a tablespoonful of dough around each candy, forming a ball.  In a small bowl, combine the remaining sugar and pecans; dip each cookie halfway.  Place nut/sugar side up 2-inches apart on greased baking sheets (or parchment paper).  Bake at 375 degrees for 7-10 minutes or until tops are slightly cracked.  Cool for 3 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely (or pull parchment paper with cookies off sheets).  Drizzle with melted white chocolate.  Should make about 5 dozen cookies.
